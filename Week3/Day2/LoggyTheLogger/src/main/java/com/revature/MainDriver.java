		 * Logging
		 * 
		 * What is logging?
		 * 		REcording events that occur during software execution. 
		 * 
		 * Why do we need logging?
		 * 		It allows (in eneral) for developers to access information about applications to which we do 
		 * 		not have direct access to. 
		 * 
		 *		Without logs, we would have no idea of knowing what went wrong when an applcition crashes, 
		 *		or perforamnce dips. 
		 *
		 *Log4j
		 *
		 *	Log4j is a reliable, fast and flexible logging framework for Java (supported by Apache).  It's commonly
		 *	used to record application events, log granular debugging inforamtion for developers and write exception 
		 *	events to files. 
		 *
		 *
		 *Logging threshold
		 *
		 *	A logger can be assigned a thrshold level. All logging requests with levels lower than this threshold be ignored.
		 *
		 *		All (everything including custom levels) < debug < info < warn < error < fatal < off (turning off logging)
