Introduction to Java

	What is Java?
		Common languages for most websites? 
		Operating system? 
		Object Oriented Programming? 
		Strongly typed? 
		A language? 
		Write Once Run Anywhere? 
		Compiled? 

		What is it and why do we use it? ? 
			Java is a compiled programming language. It is supported by Oracle and allows us
			to create robust enterprise level applications. 
			Java supports OOP - so we get all the benefits of OOP. 
			Compiled - which means that we have really nice debuggins situations. 
			WORA - Write Once Run Anywhere, anything that can host the JVM will allow us to 
				run Java code. 
			A large list of frameworks and rich documentation - is good!
			C-based : it is easier to pick up 
			Garbage Collection - automated memory management. 
			

		How does it work? 
			Pure magic. Also thanks to the JVM converting bytecode into 
			machine code.  

			JDK JRE JVM 
				JDK: Java Development Kit 
					Is what we will need to create Java code! The JDK contains 
					the JRE (and the JVM) and other tools such as the debugger and 
					the compiler! 
				(The compiler converts our human readable code to bytecode - which 
				is then translated by the JVM)

				JRE: Java Runtime Environment 
					Allows us to run Java code. It contains the JVM and core libraries.

				JVM: Java Virtual Machine 
					Translates Bytecode (machine-readable language) to machine code. 


		Create our first Hello World program!


Control Flow statments: 
	
	Control flow statements will affect the flow of how your code will be executed. 
	They allow you to repeat blocks of code or ignore it, depending on what logic 
	you've implemented.
