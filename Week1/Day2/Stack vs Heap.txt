Stack vs Heap 

	Entities in Java can be either stored in the stack or the heap.

	Speed vs size
		Stack has a much smaller capacity than Heap memory 
		Quicker retrieval of memory from stack compared to the heap. 

	What does each of these store?
		Stack: contains local (primitive) variables and reference variables to objects. 
		Heap: contains objects (and pretty much everything else)


	Uses cases?
		Stack is used by a  thread. Memory is only accessible to the thread using it. 
		Stack memory is cleared once the thread is finished using it. 

		Heap is globally access to the system (.e. all threads) and the memory is not 
		cleared untl the application is closed.
