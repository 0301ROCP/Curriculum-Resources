	 * Class vs Object
	 * 
	 * Class is essentially a blueprint for the instantiation of an object. Typically if you want to 
	 * 	access the methods and attributes 'within' a class, you'll need to instantiate it tino an 
	 * 	object (unless you use a static keyword)
	 * 
	 * Object is an implementation of a class. 
	 * 
	 * Object is a 'physical' entity, a class is a 'logical' entity. Memory is only allocated to the object. 
	 * 
	 * e.g. We can have a class "Human", "Ben" is an instance of the class "Human", making it an object of type 
	 * 	"Human"
	 * 
	 *   If we define a method for "Human", all humans will have access to that method.
	 *   We need an instance of the human to do it!
	 * 
	 * Function: 
	 * 		sub program that does somthing. A block of code that is executed when called upon. It consists of a 
	 * 		method signature and body. (allows reuse of blocks of code!)
	 * 
	 * Method: 
	 * 		A method is a function that is associated with an oboject.
