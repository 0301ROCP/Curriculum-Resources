Inheritance: 
	One of the pillars of OOP

	Is the process of inheritng properties and methods
	We use the "extends" keyword to inherit
	e.g. Truck extends Car, Truck is the child class of CAr. 
	
	Truck may have access to all of the Car's properties and methods
	The Car, is a parent, so won't have access to the Truck's methods or porperties!
	
	For homogeneous inheritance we use the keyword: "extends"
	class -> class
	abstract class -> abstract class
	abstact class -> class
	interface -> interface

	For hetrogeneous inheritance we use the keyword: "implements"
	interface -> class
	interface -> abstract class 

	Child class have access to their parent class, e.g. (multilevel inheritance)
	A -> B -> C
	C will have access to all the methods and variables in B and A. 
	B will have access to all the methods and variables in A (But not C)
	A will not have access to B's and C's methods and variables; 


	In Java classes cannot extend multiple classes.
