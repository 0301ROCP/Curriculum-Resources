# Curriculum-Resources
Welcome to the ROCP repository!

This repository will contain the majority of notes and demos shown through programme.
Please navigate to the "Environment Installation Guide", the folder will contain a step-by-step guide to installing the necessary technologies and tools for this programme. 

I've added some links for the first week of the curriculum, these are helpful external resources that will supplement the main curriculum.
