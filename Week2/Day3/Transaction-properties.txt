Properties of a Transaction
ACID:

Atomicity: All the queries execute or none of them execute!

Consistency: Does not violate referential integrity 
		(table structures aren't changed)

Isolated: Transactions don't intefere with each other. 
	(Different levels of isolation)

Durable: Data persists! (Changes to the databse still exist
		even if the local version of it breaks). 




Isolation levels: 
	Read uncommitted : it's not isolated at all. It will not
		stop any of the read phenomenas. By default, Postgres does
		not allow this option. 
		VERY INCOSISTENT

	Read committed: default isolation level in PostgreSQL. 
		Transactions only see committed data! 
		Write only locks.  (recommended for very long transactions)
	
	Repeatable reads :
		(not used often), Read/Write locks, allows phantom reads
		but stops non-repeatable phenomena
	
	Serializable:
		Read/Write locks 
		Applies Range locks in the WHERE clause of a select stttement. 
		Tables that are being read, can't be modified until the reading is done!
		(no INSERTS, no UPDATES, no DELETES).
				

Read phenomena (Bad things) 
	Dirty read: reading data that is uncommitted. 
	Non-repeatable read: when a row is read twice in a transaction 
		and the values are different. 
	Phantom read: reading datat that is being added or 
		mordified by a running transaction.
