Normalization: 
	Refers to an optimization process of structuing a relational database 
	in a way that REDUCES REDUNDANCY of data and imporoves data integrity 
	and consistency.

	We have up to 6 Normal Forms (NF), each of which build on top of each 
	other. The industry standard is 3NF.

	1NF - Every property is atomic , A primary key 
		Primary key - is a column, that every record has to have a unique value. 
				(multiple columns as well) 
	2NF - We have to achieve 1NF, no partial depedencies 
	3NF - We have to achieve 2NF, no transitive dependency. 

	If Bob can run faster than Steve, and Steve can run faster than Barry. 
	Then Bob is Faster than Barry. 
	(An example of Transitive depedency)

	a == b 
	c == b    --> c == a 

	a > b   --> a > c
	b > c

	A nice way to remember them is: 


	The key, the whole key and nothing but the key.
