Text Adventure game (House tour)

You're going to simulate a house, with at least 
	a bedroom, living room, kitchen and a bathroom. 

At the start, you'll start outside the house. 

User's are able to enter rooms using words such as:
	"left", "right", "front" and "backward"

(No option to teleport into a room, i.e. to enter 
	the kitchen, you should have to walk through the living room)
