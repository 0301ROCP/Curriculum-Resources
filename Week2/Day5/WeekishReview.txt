SQL - (Structured Query Language)
	A language that is used to interface with relational 
	databases. 

Sublanguages:

Transaction ?
	A group of SQL queries that we send to the database. 
Query?
	A single SQL statement 

Properties of a transaction (ACID)
	Atomic 
	Consistency 
	Isolation 
	Durable 

Normalization?
	Reducing data redundancy in our tables. 
	There are 6 NF. Industry standard is 3NF.

	1NF - primary key, columns are atomic
	2NF - Achieve 1NF, no partial dependencies. 
	3NF - Achieve 2NF, no transitive dependencies 

Multiplicity ?
	Relationships between tables. 
	One to one. 
	One to many. 
	Many to one. 
	Many to Many? We need the junction table to establish that!


Maven: 
	Project management tool, dependency management tool. 	
	Build automation tool. 

JDBC: 
	Java Database Connection. 
	Provides API, that abstracts away the process of connecting
	our Java application to our PostgreSQL database.
